## The LaShelle's Story
**LaShelle's School of Dance** was founded in the summer of 2004 in Detroit, MI.  Founder and CEO, Wilkanda "LaShelle" Goodman, began dancing at age three and continued all the way through college. After earning a B.A. in Education from Ferris State University and becoming a high school math teacher, she realized the lack of dance and performing arts opportunities in general for inner-city youth.  So in 2004, alongside her family and friends, she decided to found LaShelle's School of Dance.  With humble beginnings at an old church building on W. 7 Mile Rd., about 25 students and a lot of "heart," LSO Dance was born!

Since its inception, LaShelle's School of Dance has remained committed to educating students of all ages in the art of dance at affordable prices.  Far too often, gifted dancers are unable to attend studios or further their dance education because of financial barriers.  With over 200 students of various ages, skill levels and socio-economic backgrounds, we are proud to provide our dancers with a variety of classes at minimal costs.  Also, as a family owned business, we do everything with a personal touch and value all members of our "LaShelle's Family" not only as dancers but as people.  The average class size is 12 students, but no matter what size a class may be, we give every dancer the necessary personal attention.

As we celebrate our 16th anniversary season, we take honor in continuing a tradition of educating and training our students in the art of dance.  LaShelle's has a staff of quite gifted instructors, who conduct classes in a manner that is not only educational, but is also exciting and uplifting.  We hope that you will stop by soon and enroll for our current session of  classes!
